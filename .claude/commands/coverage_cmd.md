1 - UNDERSTAND the code coverage percentages for each function and method in this codebase.
2 - THEN add unit tests to functions and methods without 100% coverage. This includes negative and edge cases.
3 - ALWAYS use mocks for external functionality, such as web services and databases.
4 - THEN re-run the mechanism to display code coverage, and repeat the process as necessary.
