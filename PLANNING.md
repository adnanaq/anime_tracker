  }
  loading: {
    current: boolean
    seasonal: boolean
    upcoming: boolean
  }
  error: string | null
  actions: {
    fetchCurrentSeason: () => Promise<void>
    fetchSeasonalAnime: (year: number, season: string) => Promise<void>
    fetchUpcomingAnime: () => Promise<void>
    clearError: () => void
  }
}
```

// Simplified SeasonalAnime.tsx
export const SeasonalAnime = () => {
  const { data, loading, error, actions } = useSeasonalData()
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<TabType>('current')
  const [selectedYear, setSelectedYear] = useState(getCurrentYear())
  const [selectedSeason, setSelectedSeason] = useState(getCurrentSeason())

  // Simplified render with extracted components
  return (
    <SeasonalContainer>
      <SeasonalHeader />
      <TabNavigation {...tabProps} />
      {activeTab === 'seasonal' && <SeasonSelector {...selectorProps} />}
      <AnimeGridSection {...getSectionProps(activeTab)} />
    </SeasonalContainer>
  )
}
```

  useEffect(() => {
    const updateCountdown = () => {
      const now = Temporal.Now.instant();
      const airTime = Temporal.Instant.from(episodeDate);
      const duration = airTime.since(now);
      
      if (duration.sign === -1) {
        const hoursAgo = Math.floor(Math.abs(duration.total('hours')));
        setTimeLeft(`Aired ${hoursAgo}h ago`);
      } else {
        const days = Math.floor(duration.total('days'));
        const hours = Math.floor(duration.total('hours') % 24);
        const minutes = Math.floor(duration.total('minutes') % 60);
        
        if (days > 0) {
          setTimeLeft(`${days}d ${hours}h ${minutes}m`);
        } else if (hours > 0) {
          setTimeLeft(`${hours}h ${minutes}m`);
        } else {
          setTimeLeft(`${minutes}m`);
        }
      }
    };
    
    updateCountdown();
    const interval = setInterval(updateCountdown, 60000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [episodeDate]);

  return (
    <span className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-600 bg-blue-50 px-2 py-1 rounded">

const WatchlistIntegration = ({ anime }: { anime: AnimeBase }) => {
  const { userAnimeStatus, isAuthenticated } = useAnimeStore();
  const userStatus = userAnimeStatus[anime.malId];
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-2">
      {userStatus && (
        <StatusBadge status={userStatus.status} score={userStatus.score} />
      )}
      {isAuthenticated && !userStatus && (
        <AddToWatchlistButton anime={anime} />
      )}
      {userStatus?.status === 'watching' && (
        <EpisodeProgress 
          current={userStatus.episodesWatched} 
          total={anime.episodes} 
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 🏗️ **Implementation Architecture**

#### **Enhanced API Service Layer**
```typescript
// Extend existing animeScheduleService
export const animeScheduleService = {
  // ... existing methods

  async getAnimeDetails(slug: string): Promise<AnimeScheduleEntry | null> {
    // Get detailed anime information
  },

  async searchAnime(params: {
    q?: string;
    genres?: string[];
    studios?: string[];
    year?: number;
    season?: string;
    airType?: string;
    streamingPlatform?: string;
  }): Promise<AnimeScheduleEntry[]> {
    // Advanced search functionality
  },

  async getStreamingAvailability(malId: number): Promise<StreamingInfo[]> {
    // Cross-reference streaming availability
  }
};
```

#### **Enhanced Filter System**
```typescript
// New filtering utilities
export const scheduleFilters = {
  applyFilters(episodes: AnimeScheduleEntry[], filters: ScheduleFilters): AnimeScheduleEntry[] {
    return episodes.filter(episode => {
      // Apply all filter criteria
      if (filters.airType !== 'all' && episode.airType !== filters.airType) return false;
      if (filters.airingStatus !== 'all' && episode.airingStatus !== filters.airingStatus) return false;
      if (filters.streamingPlatform !== 'all' && !episode.streams?.[filters.streamingPlatform]) return false;
      if (filters.episodeDelay && !episode.episodeDelay) return false;
      if (filters.donghua !== episode.donghua) return false;
      if (filters.hasStreaming && !episode.streams) return false;
      if (filters.search && !episode.title.toLowerCase().includes(filters.search.toLowerCase())) return false;
      
      return true;
    });
  },

  getFilterStats(episodes: AnimeScheduleEntry[]): FilterStats {
    // Generate filter statistics for UI
  }
};
```
