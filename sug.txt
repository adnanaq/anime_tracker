Imagine a set of elegant cards laid out in a grid — each one represents a piece of content, like an anime series, with a title, image, or brief info.

When you hover over a card, it gently grows in size just a bit, signaling it's interactive. It feels alive — like it wants you to explore more.

Now, when you click on a card, it performs a sleek animation:

The card seems to flip open vertically, as if unfolding to reveal hidden content tucked underneath.

Additional information—like episode lists, synopsis, or tracking controls—expands upward from inside the card.

At the same time, all the other cards shrink slightly and fade back, like they’re politely stepping aside to focus attention on the active one.

This creates a beautiful, immersive interaction where:

Only one card is fully open at a time.

The layout doesn't shift or break — other cards remain in place, just subtly scaled down.

The user feels anchored in the context, never losing sight of where they are.

Clicking the card again (or clicking outside it) closes the detail view, smoothly restoring all cards to their original, evenly spaced layout.
