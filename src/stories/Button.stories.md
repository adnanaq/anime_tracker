### üõ† Technical Implementation

#### **Component Architecture**
```typescript
// CVA-based variant system with 8 variants, 5 sizes
const buttonVariants = cva(
  'at-button-base inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2...',
  {
    variants: {
      variant: { primary, secondary, success, warning, danger, ghost, outline, link },
      size: { xs, sm, md, lg, xl },
      animated: { true, false },
      fullWidth: { true, false }
    }
  }
)
```

#### **Feature Support**
- **Polymorphic Rendering**: Can render as button, anchor, div, or any HTML element
- **Icon Integration**: Left and right icon slots with automatic spacing
- **Loading States**: Spinner with content opacity and disabled interaction
- **Animation System**: Shimmer hover effects and click ripple animations
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper prop inheritance

#### **Dependencies**
- **Heroicons**: Icon library for comprehensive icon examples
- **CVA**: Class Variance Authority for variant management
- **Tailwind**: Utility classes for responsive and layout features

### üìä Coverage Metrics

- All 8 variants tested and documented
- All 5 sizes with visual examples
- All interactive states (loading, disabled, animated)
- All layout options (full-width, responsive)
- All advanced features (icons, polymorphic rendering)

#### **Use Cases** ‚úÖ 100%
- Action buttons (anime tracking, user interactions)
- Form controls (submit, cancel, delete)
- Navigation elements (search, pagination)
